## About Me

I am a Java Full Stack Developer with over 6 years of experience in designing, developing, and deploying enterprise-scale applications using Java, Spring Boot, React.js, and cloud-native technologies. My expertise spans backend microservices, RESTful & GraphQL APIs, and modern front-end architectures with React.js and TypeScript.

I specialize in building secure, scalable, and real-time enterprise systems for financial, healthcare, and e-commerce domains — leveraging AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD automation for continuous delivery. With proven success in data streaming (Kafka, RabbitMQ), data visualization (Chart.js, D3.js), and AI-driven coding (GitHub Copilot), I focus on delivering high-performance, maintainable, and business-driven solutions.

Passionate about solving complex problems and working in Agile teams, I take pride in delivering secure, reliable, and innovative applications that align technology with business goals.
